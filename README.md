GOAL TRACKER

Used to keep track of life goals.

I am making this because other Goal Trackers/todo lists don't really do it for me.

TODO:
  - V0.1: Have the longest word one can submit be 29 letters long - DONE
  - V0.2: Visual way to tell a goal has sub goals - DONE
  - V0.3: Visual way to see how many sub goals a goal has - DONE
  - V0.4: Arrow points up when it is open and down when it is closed - DONE
  - VO.41: 
    - BUGS: 
      - Sometimes takes two cliks to open or close - DONE
      - Opening up a goal open ALL subs, even those that are closed - DONE
  - V0.4: Security features (some bugs when submitting "==")
  - V1.0: Implement Sign Up 
  - V1.0: Implement Log In 
  - V1.0: Implement Log Out 
  - V2.0: Host online
  - V2.1: Can move a goal (and its subs) into another goal (click 'move', fade all goals except moving, moves under clicked goal)
  - V2.2: When adding a goal, a modal appears (mini window)
  - V2.3: Button to revert to being not done (only possible with topmost "done" layer)
  - V2.4: Option to "undo" deletion appears for a couple of seconds after deleting
ASYNC FEATURES:
  - V3.0: The basic async capabilities
  - V3.1: After adding a goal/pressing enter, you can type in another goal and into will go into the same parent
  - V3.2: Minor animations when adding/deleting/moving goals
